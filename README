CODE LAYOUT:

Schemas and documentation are in the "schema" and "doc"
directories. The code for the Submission Agreement Builder Tool
(SABT) is in the TAPER directory.

The TAPER directory:

Edit taper.conf, or copy to taper_local.conf and edit that, to change
the following for your local configuration:

* Application name and archive ID
* Database user and password
* Path to session data
* Session expiration time
* LDAP server hostname and user_basedn (or other authentication method)
* Email address
* Email server hostname
* XML staging directories

TEST:

Run "script/taper_server.pl -r -d" to test the application
(visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser).

There are also Perl unit test scripts in the t/ directory, which you
can run with "prove -l lib t".
