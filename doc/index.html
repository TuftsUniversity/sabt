            <h1>TAPER software administrator's guide</h1>

<p>This is a guide for administrators of the TAPER software suite.</p>

<p>The intended audience of this documentation is people with some certain amount of Unix administration know-how. Programming skill is useful but not strictly necessary.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Depending on where you got the TAPER code, you may have checked the code out of either a Subversion (SVN) or a Git repository. This documentation assumes that you checked it out of a Subversion repository. If you checked it out of Git, you will need to modify any Subversion references or commands accordingly.</p>
