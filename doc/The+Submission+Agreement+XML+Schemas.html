            <h1>Submission Agreement XML Schemas</h1>

<p>Currently, there are two discrete schemas for submission agreements. Regular Submission Agreements and Standing Submission Agreements are just enough different from each other to warrant having their definitions stored in two separate files.</p>

<h2>Schema document locations</h2>

<p>The canonical schema documents live in TAPER's Subversion repository, in the <tt>schema/</tt> directory. They are both W3 XML Schema documents.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>ssa.xsd</b> - the schema for SSAs</li>
	<li><b>rsa.xsd</b> - the schema for RSAs</li>
	<li><b>sa_common.xsd</b> - a schema containing definitions common to both RSAs and SSAs, used by both main schemas</li>
</ul>


<p>The files are meant to be self-documenting, and follow the standards set down by "<a href="Element+List--Submission+Agreements+2.0.html">Element List&#45;&#45;Submission Agreements 2.0</a>".</p>
