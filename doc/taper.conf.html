            <h1>taper.conf - the TAPER web app configuration file</h1>

<p>The TAPER web application configuration file is <tt>taper.conf</tt>, which must exist at the app's root level. It's a standard Unix-ish configuration file, similar to Apache's <tt>httpd.conf</tt>. You can also create a copy of taper.conf named <tt>taper_local.conf</tt>  and make your changes and local customizations there. We recommend you use this process, in order to prevent your local customizations from being overwritten when you update your code.</p>

<p>When installing the TAPER web app onto a new system (or a new location on a given system), then you <em>must</em> update taper.conf or taper_local.conf appropriately. Otherwise, TAPER apps will not work.</p>

<p>A boilerplate version of the file is in Subversion, but you'll almost certainly want to modify it after either creating a new TAPER web app installation, or moving an existing one to a new location.</p>

<h2>Configuration parameters</h2>

<h3>archive_id</h3>

<p>The string that the SABT uses to identify the archive constructing the submission agreement. </p>

<p>Example: <tt>Digital Collections and Archives, Tufts University</tt></p>

<h3>session</h3>

<p>Three parameters:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>storage</b> The directory (relative to the web application's root) where session information files get written.</li>
	<li><b>cookie_expires</b> The TTL of session cookies.</li>
	<li><b>expires</b> The TTL of sessions (apart from cookies).</li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, you must set <em>both</em> <tt>cookie_expires</tt> and <tt>expires</tt>, due to a foible of a third-party session-handling library we're using. Yes, that's a bit wonky. Sorry...</p>

<p>Example:<br/>
{{<br/>
&lt;session&gt;<br/>
    storage run/session<br/>
    cookie_expires 28800<br/>
    expires 28800<br/>
&lt;/session&gt;<br/>
}}</p>

<h3>authentication</h3>

<p>This section is a bit mucky, specific to the needs of the underlying LDAP-authenticating Perl module, and too complex to go into here. </p>

<p>You'll need to modify this section as necessary in order to please your own LDAP server. Please consult the documentation for Catalyst::Plugin::Authenticaion::Store for more details.</p>

<h3>dca_staff_email</h3>

<p>The email address that the SABT will send mail to  when someone creates a new RSA draft. </p>

<p>The value of this directive is literally copied to the outgoing email's <tt>To:</tt> field. Therefore, to mail multiple entities, just concatenate addresses with a comma.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p><tt>dca_staff_email    dca@example.com</tt></p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p><tt>dca_staff_email    "dca@example.com, jane_doe@example.com"</tt></p>

<h3>from_name</h3>
<h3>from_address</h3>

<p>These two directives define the name and email address that the new-RSA email will appear to come from.</p>

<p>Example:<br/>
<tt>from_name    Submission Agreement Builder Tool</tt><br/>
<tt>from_name    noreply@example.com</tt></p>

<h3>email</h3>

<p>This group of directives defines the resources that the TAPER web application will use for sending mail.</p>

<p>This one's a little opaque. You must define one <b>email</b> directive line for every argument you wish to send to the underlying email module. You can often get by with two lines: one to define the email protocol, and another for the relevant hostname. </p>

<p>See the documentation for Catalyst::Plugin::Email for full configuration information (as these config lines are sent directly to this plugin).</p>

<p>Example (using both lines):<br/>
<tt>email SMTP</tt><br/>
<tt>email localhost</tt></p>

<h3>rsa_staging_directory</h3>

<p>The absolute path to the directory where the SABT will write its RSA draft files.</p>

<p>This directory needs to be writeable by the webuser (or whatever user is running the web server that the TAPER web app uses).</p>

<h3>ssa_directory</h3>

<p>The absolute path to the directory where the SABT will write its SSA files.</p>

<p>This directory needs to be writeable by the webuser (or whatever user is running the web server that the TAPER web app uses).</p>
