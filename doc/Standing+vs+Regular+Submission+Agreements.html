            <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Submission agreements can cover a single ingest project or serial ingest project. A <em>standing</em> submission agreement covers a serial ingest project while a <em>regular</em> submission agreement covers a single ingest. A standing submission agreements would cover an agreement between a producer and an archive to transfer records on a recurring basis. Normally, records covered by a standing agreement are going to be relatively homogeneous records that the producer creates on a regular basis.</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>For example</em>: A standing submission agreement would cover the Office of the Trustees transferring trustee meeting working papers to the archive three times every year after their full board meetings in February, May, and November.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><em>For example</em>: A standing submission agreement would cover the Office of Educational Affairs, School of Medicine transferring paper course packets (syllabi) to the archive at the end of every academic year.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><em>Counter example</em>: A standing submission agreement would typically <em>not</em> cover the Department of Widget Science clearing out its filing cabinets because they are full and sending the archive a mix of records. That would be covered only by a regular submission agreement</li>
</ul>



<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>Every individual ingest project covered by a standing submission agreement has its own regular submission agreement. RSAs inherent properties from the SSA.</p>
